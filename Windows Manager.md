### Chapter 14 Summary

#### Windows Managers

  At the very core of the Linux system, you will find the X server.  This feature of Linux allows users to configure, modify, or even alter the look and feel of their desktop. Just about every feature from keyboard, mouse, desktop background, and software can be modified through the use of the X server or toolkits.  Toolkits are used more for desktop applications which will allow the user to modify layouts or features such as where buttons are located on the windows.  Toolkits are the core of desktop environments since it includes files that create the "theme" of the environment.  GNOME, KDE, Unity, and Xfce are examples of Linux desktop environments that have been around for years.  At the top of the desktop is what we as the users see; the applications.  A couple of examples of applications are either web browsers or office applications.
  
#### My thoughts on this chapter

  After years of using primarily Windows desktop environment, my perspective has changed since being introduced to Linux.  I have never used Linux before or even aware of the numerous features of Linux.  I was unaware that there were that many features that could be modified.  I have always thought that Windows is the way it is and the only features that can changed were fonts, window colors, background, or mouse speed (just to name a few common).  The only issue I would see that would be hard to understand is the printing since the book states that there is a process that printing has to go through to function.  I will have to explore these features more closely and see what I can change for my benefit.
